                        <h2> Medicine </h2>
                        <p> Medicine is the science and practice of preventing and treating disease to maintain and restore health. It encompasses a
                        wide range of substances and therapies, from pharmaceuticals and surgery to lifestyle changes, used to cure, alleviate
                        symptoms, or halt the progression of illness. Modern medicine relies on scientific and technological advancements to
                        diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases, and its practice is conducted by a variety of healthcare professionals like
                        doctors, nurses, and specialists. </p>

                            <p> Medicine is the science and practice of caring for people by preventing, diagnosing, and treating illness or injury. It
                            combines knowledge from biology, chemistry, and technology to understand how the human body works and how to restore it
                            to health when something goes wrong. Over time, medicine has evolved from traditional remedies to advanced modern
                            treatments such as vaccines, surgery, and genetic therapies. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals work
                            together to provide care and improve patients quality of life. Medicine not only helps cure diseases but also plays an
                            important role in promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing future health problems.</p>
